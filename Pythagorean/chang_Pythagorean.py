Create a file called LastName_pythagorean.py. Write a program that will ask the user to
enter their name and respond with a greeting using this name.

Next your program will ask them to enter the lengths of the legs of a right triangle a and
b. We will use these to compute the length of the hypotenuse:

Compute the length of the hypotenuse and then return the result in a print statement.
(*Donâ€™t only print the value, make sure you add both strings and floats in your statement).
